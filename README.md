# Assignment 5.1
Testing  setting up and using Git for UBC--ML
analyzing data in coupons.csv file

First, I use the  VS code to set up my Git environment  
Second I looked at the data and performed a clean up
Third   I finish the assessment on the Bar coupon
Finally, I evaluated on Coffee House coupon

 My assessment of the data found that

Six features were missing values in the data set. Data for the "car" attribute was missing 99% of its values, indicating that it will not impact further predictions. For the other five elements, I set NaN for missing values.

The results of the correlation analysis suggested 'toCoupon_GEQ5min'  that all venues were at least five minutes away from drivers and, therefore, had no impact. 'direction_opp' and 'direction_same' had an identical correlation, thus dropping one of them had no direct effects.
Distribution analysis of the percentage of accepted and rejected offers of the total count indicated that taken was slightly higher than not taken. So, focusing the research on acceptance would be acceptable.

Our results of number count demonstrate that Coffee coupons are faring better than high-end restaurants. 
Our results indicate that overall Acceptance of Coffee coupons is outstanding, and acceptance of the voucher is higher with people that visit the 1-3 times a month the Coffee House
Our results demonstrate that females are most likely to Acceptance of Coffee coupons.

The histogram shows that the higher the temperature more people used the coupons lower the temperature more carry out and Take away mid-range temperature; you see the uptake in the coffee house, bar and restaurant.

exploration of just the bar-related coupons

Our results demonstrate that only accepted bar coupons are 6.5% of total coupons and not accepted bar coupons are 9.4%, while almost equal amounts of coffee House coupons are accepted and rejected

Our results also demonstrate that the acceptance rate for MoreThen3 is higher than 3orLess. The result is squad because we included  'never' for "3 times or less."
The result shows that the age between 21 and 30 has a higher acceptance rate, and also, ages 20 and 26 are more likely to accept coupons for the bar. It also shows that the 31 and 50+ crowd is next in line to a bar.

I struggled to figure out which plot to use to represent this data. But based on a quick analysis, drivers without passengers have a higher rate  
I struggled again to figure out which plot to use to represent this data. And I am lost and tired; I lost the code multiple times until I activated autosave. It is Sunday, and I have already worked for 30H on this assignment,

I will see tomorrow if I can complete the rest
Based on observations, we could hypothesize that drivers who accepted the bar coupons are mainly single and aged between 20-30.
So It is Monday at 5 am; I could not sleep knowing I had to finish

### Independent Investigation

Based on observations, Coffee House coupon may be the best bet, so let us find out provided profile and context when the driver is most likely to accept coffee coupons 
practically 51 % VS 7% of people took Coffee House coupons if they were in 15 min range.

the temperature in the range of 65 to 70 and the age in the range  of 25 to 35 have the highest acceptance
Let us look closely.

Based on observations, gender accepted coupons equally; the higher the temperature higher the acceptance; also older the driver higher the approval.
Based on the results, based on temperature and weather, people over 36 are most likely to accept when it is snowing. So please focus on the age group > 35 when snowing and blast equally when it is sunny.

The End 8 Am on Monday.
